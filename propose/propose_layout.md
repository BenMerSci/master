**Talk about subsequent research that were efficient doing so**

1. Introduction
    1. Climate change and anthropic stressors are affecting biodiversity in all its forms ([@Estes2011, @Purves2013])
    2. Introduce the GEM model, and that we need a more mechanistic understanding of communities and ecosystems [@Harfoot2014, @Purves] (which is why we aim to explore what drives interaction strength as energy fluxes within networks of interactions)
    3. Why is the inference of interaction strength important? (Community dynamics [@Paine1988, and many others], governs system stability [@Neutel2002, @Ruiter1995], ecosystem functionning [@Duffy2002, @Montoya2003]), integration with BEF [@Barnes2018].

3. Theory
    1. Comparing interaction and interaction strength
            - 
    3. Present what has been done yet regarding the inference of interaction strength
            - Bioenergetics: explore body-mass relation and predator-prey body-mass ratio with Interaction Strength, but not mechanistically but with Lotka-Volterra framework [@Pawar2015, @Yodzis1992, @Brose2006]
            - Physics mechanisms of interaction [@Portalier2019].
            - ADBM optimal foraging theory [@Petchey2008].
