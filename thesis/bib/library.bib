abstract = {Arctic caribou (Rangifer tarandus) have the longest terrestrial migration of any ungulate but little is known about the spatial and seasonal variation of minerals in summer forages and the potential impacts of mineral nutrition on the foraging behavior and nutritional condition of arctic caribou. We inves- tigated the phenology, availability, and mechanistic relationships of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron, manganese, copper, and zinc in three species of woody browse, three species of graminoids, and one forb preferred by caribou over two transects bisecting the ranges of the Central Arctic (CAH) and Western Arctic (WAH) caribou herds in Alaska. Transects traversed three ecoregions (Coastal Plain, Arctic Foothills and Brooks Range) along known migration paths in the summer ranges of both herds. Concentrations of mineral in forages were compared to estimated dietary requirements of lactating female caribou. Spatial distribution of the abundance of minerals in caribou forage was associated with interactions of soil pH and mineral content, while temporal variation was related to plant maturity, and thus nitrogen and fiber content of forages. Concentrations of sodium were below caribou requirements in all forage species for most of the summer and adequate only on the Coastal Plain during the second half of summer. Phosphorus declined in plants from emergence to senescence and was below requirements in all forages by mid-summer, while concentrations of copper declined to marginal concentrations at plant senescence. Interactions of sodium with potassium, calcium with phosphorus, and copper with zinc in for- ages likely exacerbate the constraints of low concentrations sodium, phosphorus, and copper. Forages on the WAH contained significantly more phosphorus and copper than forages collected on the CAH transect. We suspect that migrations of caribou to the Arctic Coastal Plain may allow parturient females to replenish sodium stores depleted by foraging inland through the long arctic winters, while also extending the avail- ability of adequate phosphorus, if animals are able to selectively track emerging waves of forage.},

@article{Douhard2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Ecological Society of America. We know little about the determinants and demographic consequences of the marked seasonal mass changes exhibited by many northern and alpine mammals. We analysed 43 years of data on individual winter mass loss (the difference between mass in early June and mass in mid-September the previous year) and summer mass gain (the difference between mass in mid-September and in early June of the same year) in adult bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). We calculated relative seasonal mass change as a proportion of individual body mass at the start of each season. We first examined the effects of weather and population density on relative changes in body mass. We then assessed the consequences of relative seasonal mass changes on reproduction. Mean April-May temperature was the main driver of relative seasonal mass changes: warm springs reduced both relative winter mass loss and summer mass gain of both sexes, likely partially due to a trade-off between growth rate of plants and duration of access to high-quality forage. Because these effects cancelled each other, spring temperature did not influence mass in mid-September. Mothers that lost relatively more mass during the winter had lambs that gained less mass during summer, likely because these females allocated fewer resources to lactation. Winter survival of lambs increased with their summer mass gain. In males, relative mass loss during winter, which includes the rut, did not influence the probability of siring at least one lamb, possibly indicating that greater mating effort did not necessarily translate into greater reproductive success. Our findings improve our understanding of how weather influences recruitment and underline the importance of cryptic mechanisms behind the effects of climate change on demographic traits.},

abstract = {Although mixed effects models are widely used in ecology and evolution, their application to standardized traits that change within season or across ontogeny remains limited. Mixed models offer a robust way to standardize individual quantitative traits to a common condition such as body mass at a certain point in time (within a year or across ontogeny), or parturition date for a given climatic condition. Currently, however, most researchers use simple linear models to accomplish this task. We use both empirical and simulated data to underline the application of mixed models for standardizing trait values to a common environment for each individual. We show that mixed model standardizations provide more accurate estimates of mass parameters than linear models for all sampling regimes and especially for individuals with few repeated measures. Our simulations and analyses on empirical data both confirm that mixed models provide a better way to standardize trait values for individuals with repeated measuremen...},

abstract = {In mammals, the most significant maternal effect on offspring growth during lactation is the ability of females to efficiently transfer milk energy to their neonates. However, despite the importance of the transfer of milk energy to both maternal and offspring fitness, nothing is known about the extent to which variation among females may be attributed to differences in individual quality or environmental variation in natural populations. We measured repeatability over multiple lactation periods in components of lactation performance in free-ranging, multiparous gray seal (Halichoerus grypus) females to examine to what extent variation among females in pup weaning mass may be attributed to inherent differences in their physiological capacity to deliver milk energy. Levels of repeatability were high for milk composition (r = 0.38-0.50), daily milk output (r = 0.46), and the duration of lactation (r = 0.57), demonstrating that there are consistent differences among females in these characters across lactations and that the overall capacity of gray seal females to deliver milk energy to their pups is characteristic of individuals. The repeatability in pup weaning mass (r = 0.48) was consistent with the values for the components of total milk energy output and suggests that, over a large proportion of their reproductive life, individual gray seal females will consistently wean pups with greater or lesser probabilities of survival. Our results suggest that inherent differences among females in their physiological capacity to deliver milk energy may be an important component of variation in individual quality and, thus, lifetime reproductive success in mammals. High levels of repeatability also suggest that components of milk energy transfer may have a significant heritable genetic basis.},

abstract = {1. In mammals, nutrient allocation during lactation is a critical component of maternal care as milk intake promotes juvenile growth and survival, and hence maternal and offspring fitness. 2. Milk composition varies widely across mammals and is hypothesized to have arisen via selection pressures associated with environment, diet and life history. These hypotheses have been proposed based on observations and/or cross-species comparisons that did not standardize for stage of lactation and did not consider evolutionary history of the species in analyses. 3. We conducted the largest comparative analysis of milk composition to date accounting for phylogenetic relationships among species in order to understand the selective advantage of producing milk with specific nutritional profiles. We examined four milk constituents in association with species ecology while incorporating phylogeny in analyses. 4. Phylogenetic signal was apparent for all milk constituents examined. After controlling for phylogeny, diet and relative lactation length explained the greatest amount of variation in milk composition. Several aspects of species' ecologies, including adaptation to arid environments, reproductive output and maternal body mass were not associated with milk composition after accounting for phylogeny. 5. Our results suggest that milk composition is largely a function of evolutionary history, maternal nutrient intake and duration of milk production. Arriving at these conclusions was made possible by including the evolutionary relationships among species.},

abstract = {[The Gibbs sampler, the algorithm of Metropolis and similar iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.]},

abstract = {Technological advances have enabled a new class of multivariate models for ecology, with the potential now to specify a statistical model for abundances jointly across many taxa, to simultaneously explore interactions across taxa and the response of abundance to environmental variables. Joint models can be used for several purposes of interest to ecologists, including estimating patterns of residual correlation across taxa, ordination, multivariate inference about environmental effects and environment-by-trait interactions, accounting for missing predictors, and improving predictions in situations where one can leverage knowledge of some species to predict others. We demonstrate this by example and discuss recent computation tools and future directions. Many ecological questions require the joint analysis of abundances collected simultaneously across many taxonomic groups, and, if organisms are identified using modern tools such as metabarcoding, their number can be in the thousands.While historically such data have been analyzed using ad hoc algorithms, it is now possible to fully specify joint statistical models for abundance using multivariate extensions of generalized linear mixed models.These modern 'joint modeling' approaches allow the study of correlation patterns across taxa, at the same time as studying environmental response, to tease the two apart.Latent variable models are an especially exciting tool that has recently been used for ordination as well as for studying the factors driving co-occurrence.},

abstract = {The ability to cope with environmental change is fundamental to a species' evolution. Organisms can respond to seasonal environmental variation through phenotypic plasticity. The substantial plasticity in body mass of temperate species has often been considered a simple consequence of change in environmental quality, but could also have evolved as an adaptation to seasonality. We investigated the genetic basis of, and selection acting on, seasonal plasticity in body mass for wild bighorn sheep ewes (Ovis canadensis) at Ram Mountain, Alberta, under two contrasting environmental conditions. Heritability of plasticity, estimated as mass-specific summer and winter mass changes, was low but significant. The additive genetic variance component of relative summer mass change was greater under good environmental conditions (characterized by a population increase and high juvenile survival) than under poor conditions (population decrease and low juvenile survival). Additive genetic variance of relative winter mass change appeared independent of environmental conditions. We found evidence of selection on summer (relative) and winter (relative and absolute) mass change. For a given mass, more plastic individuals (with greater seasonal mass changes) achieve greater fitness through reproduction in the following year. However, genetic correlations between mass parameters were positive. Our study supports the hypothesis that seasonal plasticity in body mass in vertebrates is an adaptation that evolved under natural selection to cope with environmental variation but genetic correlations with other traits might limit its evolutionary potential.},

The lactation strategy of a species has four interrelated dimensions: the frequency and duration of nursing bouts, the period of lactation until weaning, the number and sex ratio of infants that a mother rears simultaneously, and the composition and yield of the milk that mothers synthesize. Milk synthesis, arguably the most physiologically costly component of rearing infants, remains the least studied. Energy transfer becomes energetically less efficient, transitioning from placental support to milk synthesis just as the energy requirements for infant growth, development, and behavioral activity substantially increase. Here we review primate lactation biology and milk synthesis, integrating studies from anthropology, biology, nutrition, animal science, immunology, and biochemistry, to identify the derived and ancestral features of primate milks and enhance our understanding of primate life history.},

To test the hypothesis that reproductive success and the costs of reproduction vary according to mass and population density, we analyzed 25 yr of data on bighorn ewes (Ovis canadensis). The number of adult females was first limited by yearly removals, then allowed to triple. We found no survival costs of reproduction for ewes aged 4-7 yr. For ewes aged 8-14 yr, survival was density dependent for barren ewes but not for ewes that weaned lambs. Failure to lamb was rare and negatively correlated with fertility the following year. At low population density, lactation had a negative effect on mass gain but had a limited reproductive cost. At high density, heavy ewes had higher reproductive success than light ewes, and the reproductive cost and somatic costs of reproduction increased. The cost of reproduction was greater for light than for heavy ewes. Survival of weaned lambs to 1 yr was affected by population density but not by maternal mass or previous reproductive success. In large mammals, manipulations of reproductive effort are problematic, but long-term monitoring of individual mass and reproductive success under varying conditions of resource availability can provide insights into the evolution of life histories.},
