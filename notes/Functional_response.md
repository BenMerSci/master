- Models like the Niche model of Williams and Martinez successfully reproduces network structure with their method, but don't explain the underlying mechanisms of these patterns.
- "Most food web data are still irremediably spatially, temporally and/or taxonomically aggregated (Martinez, Hawkins, Dawah & Feifarek, 1999)"
--> Thus estimation of parameters that we make on food web depends largely on the sampling effort. How much trust can we put on the sampling effort, and biases from the samplers etc., etc.

The approach of Portalier is based on the search, capture and handling time of the prey by the predator. Based on a relationship between body-size and metabolic expenditure, they compute an energy budget which helps in prediction of pairwise interaction in the sense that it checks if the interaction is mechanistically feasable and profitable.

# Book predator ecology
- Relates the predator foraging rates depending on the prey availability. When there is nothing to eat (0 prey density), the foraging rate is anchored at 0. It has a  positive slope at low prey density. When prey density increases, the functional response does generally 3 things, either:

1) Type I functional reponse (linear)
2) Type II functional response (saturating)
3) Type III functional response (sigmoidal)
