- Size-based (allometric) theory predicts a decrease in biomass with increasing individual size due to increasing metabolic requirements and inefficient energy transfer across trophic levels. (Can we observe that in our networks?)
-  Bottom-up ressources are abundant, and predation is limited by rate of consumption of individual predator
- Larger animal need more energy to meet metabolic requirements
